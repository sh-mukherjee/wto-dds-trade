# WTO Digitally Delivered Services Trade Database and International Trade Statistics
In this repo we'll store the data files for WTO Digitally Delivered Services Trade Database and create apps with it using various Python libraries
The data is downloaded from the WTO website: https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/statis_e/gstdh_digital_services_e.htm
I have also downloaded and saved the Excel files for 'Merchandise Imports by Product Group' and 'Merchandise Exports by Product Group' (both in million USD, annual) 
from the website https://stats.wto.org/, to this repo
I will build apps from this data using Vizro or Streamlit first. Later I will try to replicate the app in Dash, Panel and Gradio to see how it looks.
