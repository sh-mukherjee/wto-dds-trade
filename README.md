# WTO Digitally Delivered Services Trade Database
In this repo we'll store the data files for WTO Digitally Delivered Services Trade Database and create apps with it using various Python libraries
The data is downloaded from the WTO website: https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/statis_e/gstdh_digital_services_e.htm
I will build apps from this data using Streamlit first. Later I will try to replicate the app in Dash, Panel and Gradio to see how it looks.
